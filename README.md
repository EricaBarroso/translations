## Welcome to the Nextstrain translations repo

This repo houses markdown files of content to be translated into language other than English, including the weekly situation reports on COVID-19. 

We welcome translations of the situation reports (narratives) into languages other than English (in particular to languages commonly spoken in areas affected by the outbreak). We're incredibly grateful for and impressed by the contributions provided already!
